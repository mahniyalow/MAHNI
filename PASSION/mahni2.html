        <p> What is MAHNI?"</p>
        <p> "많이" is a korean term, which translates to "many."
        it is pronounced "MAH-NI."</p>
        <p>MAHNI is a clothing brand that targets dancers and fashion lovers as a whole. As a dancer with interest in fashion, I wanted to a brand that reflect dancing in;
    
         <ul><a>* movement</ul>
        <ul><a>* silhouette</ul>
        <p> and </p>
        <ul><a>* identity</ul>
        <p>My goal is to represent and share how we as individuals are not made to fit just one subject or style, but we are made to fit many movements.
